# Flask Boilerplate
## Basic setup of a Flask App.

## Setup

Simply clone this repo, and then copy your own directory using `cp . path/to/where/your/project/will/be`.

If it's needed, be sure to use a virtual environment and export variables accordingly.

`export FLASK_APP=flask_boilerplate`
`export FLASK_ENV=development`

Finally, run `flask run`. The server should open on 127.0.0.1:5000. You should see "Hello World."
